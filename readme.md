## About Me 
Hi, I’m Kevin — a former strategist and startup advisor turned data analyst with a passion for helping companies make smarter, data-driven decisions. Over the past 8+ years, I’ve worked with 250+ startups and a Fortune 10 company, bringing together strategy, innovation, and data storytelling. Today, I specialize in projects that bridge the gap between business goals and technical execution, using tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI.

I’m currently focused on solving real-world business problems through data analytics, with a long-term goal of growing into a Data Scientist role.
