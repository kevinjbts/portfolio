# Summary

Utilizing the zeroAirBnB dataset (focusing on Seattle, Washington), this project provides exploratory data analysis of AirBnB data, with a focus on mapping data across various KPI's, including price by bedroom, listings by bedroom, price by zipcode and price by date. 

**Takeaways:** Rentals with larger number of bedrooms correspond to an overall higher price, which also corresponds to a significant decrease in total number of listings after one bedroom (1,811 vs. 483 for 2 bedrooms). By zipcode, average price increases with proximity to city center. Based on seasonality, average price is overall consistent, except for Jan - March.
